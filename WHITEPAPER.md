## Abstract
Aethon Labs is a decentralized low-code platform for building intelligent AI agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), with a focus on Web3 and on-chain applications. Designed for developers, creators, and businesses, Aethon Labs enables seamless visual orchestration of AI workflows and automation using blockchain infrastructure. The ecosystem includes the $AETH token, an NFT utility collection, and an AI-driven agent marketplace. This whitepaper outlines the architecture, LLM integration, tokenomics, and the role of NFTs within the Aethon Labs framework.


## 1. Vision
To empower the next generation of AI creators and decentralized applications by bridging intelligent agents with blockchain ecosystems using low-code tools.


## 2. Components of Aethon Labs

### 2.1 Visual Low-Code Platform
- **Drag-and-drop interface** for building LLM-powered agents
- Pre-built nodes for common Web3 and AI tasks
- Integrations with OpenAI, Anthropic, HuggingFace, etc.
- Support for smart contract execution, on-chain queries, and wallet authentication

### 2.2 Large Language Model Integration
LLMs are accessed via modular nodes:
- Chat agents (GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA)
- Embedding models for vector search (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone)
- Summarization, sentiment analysis, and classification workflows

**Formula:**
```
Agent_Output = f(LLM_i, Prompt, Memory_t, Tools_k)
```
Where:
- LLM_i: Selected language model instance
- Prompt: Structured input query
- Memory_t: Temporal memory embedding
- Tools_k: External modules (e.g., web search, smart contract execution)

### 2.3 Agent Orchestration Engine
- Contextual memory embedding
- External tool calling (plugins, oracles)
- Fine-tuned logic trees for branching workflows
- Multi-agent delegation and coordination


## 3. NFT Utility Collection

### 3.1 Aethon Pass (NFT)
The Aethon Pass is a single-tier NFT collection with a total supply of 10,000. Each pass unlocks exclusive benefits across the Aethon Labs platform:
- **Compute Boosts**: Priority access to GPU-based agent execution
- **Marketplace Perks**: Reduced fees and special listings
- **Voting Rights**: Participate in DAO governance
- **Agent Customization**: Access to unique agent skins and features

### 3.2 NFT Staking
Pass holders can stake their NFTs to earn $AETH tokens:
```
Yield = BaseRate * Time_Staked
```


## 4. Tokenomics ($AETH)

### 4.1 Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 $AETH

### 4.2 Allocation
| Category             | % Allocation | Cliff & Vesting                  |
|----------------------|--------------|----------------------------------|
| Ecosystem/Rewards    | 40%          | No cliff, linear vesting         |
| Team & Advisors      | 20%          | 12-month cliff, 36-month vesting |
| Treasury/DAO         | 20%          | Controlled by governance         |
| Liquidity & CEX/DEX  | 10%          | Unlocked                         |
| NFT Holder Incentives| 10%          | Based on staking                 |

### 4.3 Token Utility
- Pay for compute and API access
- Agent marketplace transactions
- Governance via DAO
- Staking for rewards and NFTs


## 5. Architecture Overview

### 5.1 Workflow Layer
- Users build AI workflows via UI
- Stored as JSON logic trees

### 5.2 Execution Layer
- Serverless backend (or user-hosted)
- Executes workflows using:
  - Token-authenticated LLM APIs
  - On-chain calls via Web3.js or Ethers.js
  - External APIs (oracles, IPFS, etc.)

### 5.3 Marketplace Layer
- Users publish, buy, and fork agent templates
- Ratings, feedback, version control

### 5.4 Governance
- DAO controls roadmap, treasury, and major decisions
- NFT and token-based voting power


## 6. Security & Compliance
- API key encryption at rest
- User workspace isolation
- Optional wallet signature for agent authorization
- Ongoing audits for smart contracts and backend


## 7. Roadmap (2025â€“2026)
| Quarter | Milestone                          |
|---------|------------------------------------|
| Q2 2025 | Beta Launch, NFT Mint, Token Gen   |
| Q3 2025 | Agent Marketplace + DAO Launch     |
| Q4 2025 | LLM Plugins, Multi-agent Collab    |
| Q1 2026 | Mobile UI + On-chain AI Indexers   |


## Conclusion
Aethon Labs merges AI and decentralization to build a powerful, modular system where agents become composable digital workers. With token incentives, NFT utilities, and LLM-driven architecture, the project pioneers the future of decentralized automation.
