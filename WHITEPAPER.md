## Abstract
Aethon Labs is a decentralized low-code platform designed for building intelligent AI agents using large language models (LLMs), tailored for Web3 and on-chain ecosystems. This whitepaper explores the system architecture, real-world use cases, tokenomics, and the unique NFT-based access mechanism behind Aethon Labs. We provide technical depth where necessary while offering plain-language explanations for accessibility.

## 1. Vision
Enable anyone from developers to creators to build decentralized AI agents that can operate, learn, and interact across the blockchain using drag-and-drop tools and secure integrations.


## 2. Platform Overview

### 2.1 Low-Code Builder
- Visual node-based interface for designing AI workflows
- Drag-and-drop integrations with LLMs, smart contracts, APIs
- Exportable JSON-based logic templates for portability

### 2.2 Language Model Integration
Supported models include OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, and Hugging Face.

**Advanced Formula (explained below):**
```
Agent_Output(t) = LLM(Prompt + Memory + ExternalTools)
```
**Plain Explanation:**
The AI response is generated by combining:
- The user's current message
- Relevant past memory
- Data from plugins or smart contracts

### 2.3 Memory Handling
```
Memory_{next} = alpha * Memory_{current} + (1 - alpha) * NewInfo
```
**Plain Explanation:**
The system blends new insights with what the agent already knows to stay both smart and up-to-date.

### 2.4 Agent Orchestration
Supports multi-step logic trees, external API execution, and multi-agent delegation. Here's an example workflow:
```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {"id": "1", "type": "Input"},
    {"id": "2", "type": "LLM", "input": "1"},
    {"id": "3", "type": "SmartContractCall", "input": "2"},
    {"id": "4", "type": "Output", "input": "3"}
  ]
}
```


## 3. NFT Access Pass

### 3.1 Aethon Pass
- 10,000 NFT collection
- Unlocks platform features, voting rights, and visual agent customization

### 3.2 Staking
```
Yield(t) = BaseRate * log(1 + Days_Staked)
```
**Plain Explanation:**
The longer you stake, the more tokens you earn—but rewards grow slower over time to keep things fair. This is because the formula uses a logarithmic function, which starts off fast but gradually flattens out. It means you get decent rewards early on, but to keep earning significantly more, you'd need to stake for much longer. This design prevents someone from earning an unlimited number of tokens just by holding indefinitely, making the system more balanced for everyone.

**Anti-Exploitation Measures:**
To ensure fairness and prevent manipulation of the staking mechanism:
- **Staking Caps:** Each wallet has a maximum effective stake amount to discourage whales from dominating rewards.
- **Early Withdrawal Penalties:** Unstaking before a minimum time results in forfeited or reduced rewards.
- **Dynamic Base Rate:** If the staking pool becomes saturated, the protocol can reduce the base rate algorithmically.
- **Sybil Protection:** Anti-Sybil checks prevent a single user from abusing the system with multiple wallets.

These controls ensure that staking remains beneficial for committed participants without opening doors to unfair accumulation.


## 4. Tokenomics ($AETH)

### Supply: 1,000,000,000

| Allocation            | %   | Notes                                 |
|-----------------------|-----|----------------------------------------|
| Ecosystem/Rewards     | 40% | Community rewards + protocol usage     |
| Team & Advisors       | 20% | With cliff and vesting                 |
| DAO Treasury          | 20% | Managed by Aethon DAO                  |
| Liquidity & Exchanges | 10% | CEX + DEX listings                     |
| NFT Holder Incentives | 10% | Based on staking duration              |

### Utility
- Pay for AI compute time
- Buy/sell agent templates
- Stake to earn rewards
- Vote in DAO proposals


## 5. System Architecture

### 5.1 Workflow Engine
```
Workflow = (Nodes, Edges)
Nodes = {LLM, Tool, Prompt, Output}
Edges = connect inputs/outputs
```
**Plain Explanation:**
Each node represents a task or AI function, and they’re connected like a roadmap to guide your agent’s thinking.

### 5.2 Execution Layer
- Supports token-gated API access
- Integrates with smart contracts
- Decentralized or hosted deployment

### 5.3 Agent Marketplace
- Browse or fork other people’s agents
- Upload your own templates
- Pay in $AETH to deploy

### 5.4 Governance
- Vote using $AETH or NFT passes
- Treasury spending and roadmap proposals are community-controlled


## 6. Security
- Data isolation per user
- Signed wallet sessions for agent control
- Encrypted API keys and memory vectors


## 7. Roadmap Highlights

| Quarter | Feature                             |
|---------|--------------------------------------|
| Q2 2025 | Beta Launch + NFT Mint + $AETH TGE   |
| Q3 2025 | Marketplace, DAO, Templates          |
| Q4 2025 | Multi-agent support + SDK            |
| Q1 2026 | Mobile + Advanced Indexing Agents    |


## Conclusion
Aethon Labs is building the infrastructure for decentralized, autonomous agents that can think, learn, and act across the Web3 world. With open tooling, token incentives, and modular LLMs, Aethon is unlocking intelligent automation for everyone.
